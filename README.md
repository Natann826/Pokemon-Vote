# Pokemon-Vote
Website that allows users to vote for their favorite Pokémon!

it's basically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALy6e7GbDRQ">this video</a> by Tom Scott but for Pokémon

I webscraped all the data from <a href="https://www.pokemondb.com">pokemondb.com</a>. I then made a website using Flask and wrote some js to allow the users to "vote" for whatever Pokémon they like best. This is sent back to the backend and recorded in a json file (scores.json).
My goal with this project was flexibility and intuitiveness. I didn't want to copy and paste any code, and I wanted additions to be as easy as possible. For the most part, it is, so I'm pretty happy.

Go ahead and vote <a href="https://ncherny.pythonanywhere.com">here!</a>
